{"_commit": "C-Support Vector Classification.
The implementation is based on libsvm. The fit time complexity is more than quadratic with the number of samples which makes it hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples.
C: float, optional (default=1.0)
Penalty parameter C of the error term.

kernel: string, optional (default='rbf')
Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm. It must be one of 'linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid', 'precomputed' or a callable.

degree: int, optional (default=3)
Degree of the polynomial kernel function ('poly'). Ignored by all other kernels.

gamma: float, optional (default='auto')
Kernel coefficient for 'rbf', 'poly' and 'sigmoid'.
Current default is 'auto' which uses 1 / n_features, if gamma='scale' is passed then it uses 1 / (n_features * X.std()) as value of gamma. The current default of gamma, 'auto', will change to 'scale' in version 0.22. 'auto_deprecated', a deprecated version of 'auto' is used as a default indicating that no explicit value of gamma was passed.
