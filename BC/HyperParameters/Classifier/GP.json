{"_commit": "Gaussian process classification (GPC) based on Laplace approximation.

The implementation is based on Algorithm 3.1, 3.2, and 5.1 of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) by Rasmussen and Williams.

Internally, the Laplace approximation is used for approximating the non-Gaussian posterior by a Gaussian.

Currently, the implementation is restricted to using the logistic link function. For multi-class classification, several binary one-versus rest classifiers are fitted. Note that this class thus does not implement a true multi-class Laplace approximation.
